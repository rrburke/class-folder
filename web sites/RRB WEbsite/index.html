<p>I am currently attending Pearl River Community college, majoring in Web design and Computer Networking. 
I am a member of Phi Beta Kappa and currently on the Deans list. </p>
<p> 	I am a retired Naval Avionics Electronic Technician (Air Warfare) Petty Officer First Class.  After 
   boot camp in San Diego Ca., and attending Avionics "A" school in Millington TN., I was stationed 
with VP-6 in Barbers Point Hi. This squadron consisted of 9 P-3 Orion aircraft designed to hunt, track, and destroy enemy submarines.  At the completion of this tour of duty I returned to Millington TN. as an 
Instructor at the Avionics "A" school for three years. My next tour returned me to San Diego CA. to join the commissioning
crew of the USS Essex LHD2 amphibious assault platform. I served aboard this ship for six years; visiting
numerous ports in the Middle East, Austraila, Kuiwait, Africa and several other countries. I was onboard for Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The final tour I was stationed at the Naval Air Logistics Command in New Orleans, La.  We scheduled flights, booked military passengers, and cargo to be flown any where in the world.  
</p>
<p> 	After graduating from PRCC I am planning on doing Web design and some local home network repair
in the local area.
